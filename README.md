# Bonnawho?

Bonnawho? is an app that allows users to view and filter the Bonnaroo 2016 lineup and save artists to listen to later. The app integrates with the Spotify API to let users listen to albums by their saved artists or sample the lineup through a playlist. Users can add ratings and comments to artists, and the app uses that information to build a suggested schedule for the user.

To install dependencies:
